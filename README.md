# CODE CHALLENGE.

The repository contains solutions to three toy problems: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator.

# Student Grade Generator.
The program prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100 and outputs the corresponding grade:
. A: >79
. B: 60 to 79
. C: 49 to 59
. D: 40 to 49
. E: less than 40

# Speed Detector.
The program takes the speed of a car as input. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "OK". Otherwise, for every 5km/h above the speed limit (70km/h), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, it prints "Licence suspended".

# Net Salary Calculator.
This program calculates an individual's net salary based on inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (tax). NHIF deduction, NSSF deduction, gross salary and net salary.
